Uhmm, hello!

Well, this is a repsository of challenges given to us in the Coding Bootcamp at Vivixx Academy...

Actually, these are just some of the challenges; To be honest, they're the ones I kinda made sure were functioning properly. Though I say they are functionting properly, I'm not saying they have complete functions. In short, they work, but they don't have all the functions you would want them to have.

I'll add the other challenges once I've fixed the codes on them and all.

Anyway, here's a summary of what the programs in this repository [so far] can do:

 * C2AutoCashierLooped.rb:
        - This acts as an automated cashier for a fruit shop:
            - It starts with an opening screen with the option to view the items or end the program.
            - These are the possibilities when the 'Items' option is typed in:
                + First, there will be a display of the items available for purchase.
                + The user then can type in the name of the item he/she wants to purchase. After that, the user will be asked to type in how much of that item he/she wants to buy.
                + The user will be asked if he/she wants to add more items. If yes, the user will return to the item list and will be able to to choose more items. This will happen until the user decides to type 'no'.
                    * When the user does type 'no', additional options will be available:
                        + 'Pay' will allow the user to pay for the items.
