Hi!

So this is a small gem that shows some animations. Well just 2 for now.

Here are some things you need:
 Files:
   c10animation-0.0.1.gem
How to install:
 - In PowerShell:
   -Type 'gem install c10animation-0.0.1.gem'


How to Use:
 - In PowerShell:
   - Type 'irb'
   - Type " require 'c10animation' "
	
	*Available commands:
		Animation.side_to_side
		Animation.gymnastics
	

	* Oh yeah, the animations loop for 5 rounds. so it'll stop eventaully.

I'll add more animations soon...well sort of. Probably best not to hope too much.
